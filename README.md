# Hardhat template 

Template hardhat repository for ad-hoc smart contracts development.

### How to use

The template works out of the box. To clean up the repo, you may need to delete the mock contracts, tests and migration files.

#### Test

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Or to see the coverage, run:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

#### Local deployment

To deploy the contracts locally, run the following commands (in the different terminals):

```bash
npm run private-network
npm run deploy-local
```

#### Bindings

The command to generate the bindings is as follows:

```bash
npm run generate-types
```

> See the full list of available commands in the `package.json` file.
